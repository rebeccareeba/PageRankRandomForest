1. What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree? (<= 50 words)
Random Forest are typically more accurate than single decision trees. Decision Tree can be easily overfit while random forest has more diversity. Each random forest tree learn on random sample, and at each node, a random set of features are considered for splitting. Both mechanisms create diversity among the trees. 
2. How long did your random forest take to run? (in seconds) 82.52
3. What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain? 76.22%
