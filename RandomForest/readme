In random forests, it is not necessary to perform explicit cross-validation or use a separate test set for performance evaluation. Out-of-bag (OOB) error estimate has shown to be reasonably accurate and unbiased. Below, we summarize the key points about OOB described in the original article by Breiman and Cutler.

Each tree in the forest is constructed using a different bootstrap sample from the original data. Each bootstrap sample is constructed by randomly sampling from the original dataset with replacement (usually, a bootstrap sample has the same size as the original dataset). Statistically, about one-third of the cases are left out of the bootstrap sample and not used in the construction of the kth tree. For each record left out in the construction of the kth tree, it can be assigned a class by the kth tree. As a result, each record will have a “test set” classification by the subset of trees that treat the record as an out-of-bag sample. The majority vote for that record will be its predicted class. The proportion of times that a predicted class is not equal to the true class of a record averaged overall records is the OOB error estimate.


While splitting a tree at a node, make sure to randomly select a subset of variable (You can use square root of number of attributes) and pick the best variable and split-point among the subset only. This is an important difference between random forest and bagging decision trees.
